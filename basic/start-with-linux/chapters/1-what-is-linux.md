# What is Linux

Linux is a free implementation of a Unix like computer operating system.

## Free?
- Free as in you do not need to pay for it
```bash
    1- You may need to pay for the distribution
    2- You may need to pay for support
```
- Free as in you are free to do what you want with it
```bash
  (as long as you pass that freedom on)
```
> *Strictly speak Linux is just the Kernel. The rest of the environment associated with it started off as the GNU project and more formally the whole environment is known as GNU/Linux. Linux provides a free Unix like operating system. It is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License.*
>
> *Modern Linux distributions tend to include vast numbers of useful software tools, from the Unix like utilities which are the subject of this class through to environments such as Apache and Tomcat (Web & JSP Server), MySQL (an SQL Database), XEN & KVM Virtualization environments, Gnome & KDE desktops, Open Office office productivity software.*

# What is an Operating System ?

An operating system is a special computer program (software) that controls the computer (hardware). The operating system serves as a liaison between the consumers and the resources, often coordinating the allocation of limited resources among numerous
consumers. The resources include, for example, the CPU, disks, memory, and printers and the consumers are running programs requiring access to the resources. As an example, a user (or a program) requests to store a file on the disk, the operating system intervenes to manage the allocation of space on the disk, and the transfer of the information from memory to the disk

When a user requests program execution, the operating system must allocate space in memory to load and access the program. As the program executes, it is allowed access to the Central Processing Unit (CPU). In a time-sharing system, there are often several
programs trying to access the CPU at the same time.

The operating system controls how and when a program will have its turn in the CPU, similar to a policeman directing traffic in a complex intersection. The intersection is analogous to the CPU; there is only one available.Each road entering the intersection is like a program. Traffic from only one road can access the intersection at any one time, and the policeman specifies which road has access to the intersection, eventually giving all roads access through the intersection.

# History of UNIX & Linux

The UNIX operating system started at Bell Laboratories in 1969. Ken Thompson, supported by Rudd Canaday, Doug McIlroy, Joe Ossana, and Dennis Ritchie, wrote a small generalpurpose time-sharing system which started to attract attention. With a promise to provide good document preparation tools to the administrative staff at the Labs, the early developers obtained a larger computer and proceeded with the development.

In the mid 1970s the UNIX system was licensed to universities and gained a wide popularity in the academic community for the following reasons:

- It was small — early systems used a 512-kilobyte disk, using 16 kilobytes for the system, 8 KB for user programs, and 64 KB for files.
- It was flexible — the source was available, and it was written in a high-level language that promoted the portability of the operating system.
- It was cheap — universities were able to receive a UNIX system license basically for the price of a tape. Early versions of the UNIX system provided powerful capabilities that were available only in operating systems that were running on more expensive
hardware.

These advantages offset the disadvantages of the system at the time:

- It had no support — AT&T had spent enough resources on MULTICS and was not interested in pursuing the UNIX operating system.
- It was “buggy” — and since there was no support, there was no guarantee of bug fixes.
- It had little or no documentation, but you could always go to the source code

When the UNIX operating system reached the University of California at Berkeley, the Berkeley users created their own version of the system. Supported by the Department of Defense, they incorporated many new features. Berkeley, as a research institute, offered its licensees a support policy similar to AT&T's — none!

AT&T recognized the potential of the operating system and started licensing the system commercially. To enhance their product, they united internal UNIX system development that was being completed in different departments within AT&T, and also started to incorporate enhancements that Berkeley had developed.

Later success can be attributed to:
- A flexible user interface, and an operating environment that includes numerous utilities.
- The modularity of the system design that allows new utilities to be added.
- Capability to support multiple processes and multiple users concurrently.
- DARPA support at Berkeley.
- Availability of relatively powerful and cheap microcomputers.
- Availability of the UNIX system on a wide range of hardware platforms.
- Standardization of the interface definition to promote application portability

## Linux Standards

A variety of standards bodies have recently been created to oversee the development of the Linux operating system and associated utilities.

## WHY SHOULD YOU LEARN ABOUT LINUX?

Linux is a critical technology for IT professionals to understand.

Linux is in widespread use, and if you use the internet at all, you are probably already interacting with Linux systems in your daily life. Perhaps the most obvious way in which you interact with Linux systems is through browsing the World Wide Web and using e-commerce sites to buy and sell products.

However, Linux is in use for much more than that. Linux manages point-of-sale systems and the world's stock markets, and also powers smart TVs and in-flight entertainment systems. It powers most of the top 500 supercomputers in the world. Linux provides the foundational technologies powering the cloud revolution and the tools used to build the next generation of container-based microservices applications, software-based storage technologies, and big data solutions.

In the modern data center, Linux and Microsoft Windows are the major players, and Linux is a growing segment in that space. Some of the many reasons to learn Linux include:
* A Windows user needs to interoperate with Linux.
* In application development, Linux hosts the application or its runtime.
* In cloud computing, the cloud instances in the private or public cloud environment use Linux as the operating system.
* With mobile applications or the Internet of Things (IoT), the chances are high that the operating system of your device uses Linux.
* If you are looking for new opportunities in IT, Linux skills are in high demand.
