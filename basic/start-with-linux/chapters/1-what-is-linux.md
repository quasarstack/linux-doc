# What is Linux

Linux is a free implementation of a Unix like computer operating system.

## Free?
- Free as in you do not need to pay for it
```bash
    1- You may need to pay for the distribution
    2- You may need to pay for support
```
- Free as in you are free to do what you want with it
```bash
  (as long as you pass that freedom on)
```
> *Strictly speak Linux is just the Kernel. The rest of the environment associated with it started
off as the GNU project and more formally the whole environment is known as GNU/Linux.
Linux provides a free Unix like operating system. It is distributed under the terms of the
GNU General Public License.*

> *Modern Linux distributions tend to include vast numbers of useful software tools, from the
Unix like utilities which are the subject of this class through to environments such as Apache
and Tomcat (Web & JSP Server), MySQL (an SQL Database), XEN & KVM Virtualization
environments, Gnome & KDE desktops, Open Office office productivity software.*

## Linux Standards

A variety of standards bodies have recently been created to oversee the development of the Linux operating system and associated utilities.

## WHY SHOULD YOU LEARN ABOUT LINUX?

Linux is a critical technology for IT professionals to understand.

Linux is in widespread use, and if you use the internet at all, you are probably already interacting with Linux systems in your daily life. Perhaps the most obvious way in which you interact with Linux systems is through browsing the World Wide Web and using e-commerce sites to buy and sell products.

However, Linux is in use for much more than that. Linux manages point-of-sale systems and the world's stock markets, and also powers smart TVs and in-flight entertainment systems. It powers most of the top 500 supercomputers in the world. Linux provides the foundational technologies powering the cloud revolution and the tools used to build the next generation of container-based microservices applications, software-based storage technologies, and big data solutions.

In the modern data center, Linux and Microsoft Windows are the major players, and Linux is a growing segment in that space. Some of the many reasons to learn Linux include:
* A Windows user needs to interoperate with Linux.
* In application development, Linux hosts the application or its runtime.
* In cloud computing, the cloud instances in the private or public cloud environment use Linux as the operating system.
* With mobile applications or the Internet of Things (IoT), the chances are high that the operating system of your device uses Linux.
* If you are looking for new opportunities in IT, Linux skills are in high demand.
